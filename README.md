This repository is a work-in-progress implementation of the SpaceTraders API in Kotlin leveraging coroutines.  The API 
is by no means stable, so expect some churn in the near term.

The goal for this project is to have an easy to use, functional programming-friendly API client which supports most MPP 
targets.  The big goals are at least Kotlin/JVM, Kotlin/JS, and Kotlin/WASM.
